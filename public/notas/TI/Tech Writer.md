# Google Technical Writing
-   Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
-   Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
    -   The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
    -   The acronym appears many times in the document.
-   Only use a pronoun _after_ you've introduced the noun; never use the pronoun before you've introduced the noun.
-   Place the pronoun as close as possible to the referring noun. In general, if more than five words separate your noun from your pronoun, consider repeating the noun instead of using the pronoun.
-   If you introduce a second noun between your noun and your pronoun, reuse your noun instead of using a pronoun.
-   Replace **this** or **that** with the appropriate noun.
-   Place a noun immediately after **this** or **that**.
-   Convert passive voice to active voice because active voice is usually clearer.
-   Many technical writers believe that the verb is the most important part of a sentence. Pick the right verb and the rest of the sentence will take care of itself.
-   Reduce there is/there are. Sentences that start with **There is** or **There are** marry a generic noun to a generic verb. Generic weddings bore readers. You can sometimes repair a There is or There are sentence by moving the true subject and true verb from the end of the sentence to the beginning.
-   When you see the conjunction or in a long sentence, consider refactoring that sentence into a bulleted list. When you see an embedded list of items or tasks within a long sentence, consider refactoring that sentence into a bulleted or numbered list.
